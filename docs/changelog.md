# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v0.2.1
2026-09-27

**Startup**
- Local startup now names invalid Clerk and Convex settings before opening a broken app.

**Episodes**
- Adding a video now shows the server's error so setup and transcript failures are easier to diagnose.

**Library**
- Library failures now show the server's error instead of a generic message.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Chat system prompt redesigned: full transcript (0 to pause point) as conversational anchor
- Context assembly simplified: direct Convex query instead of action + semantic search
- Resume handler no longer triggers expensive memory-building LLM calls
- Chat/end route simplified to no-op stub
- Episode ingestion no longer schedules embedding or profile rebuild jobs

### Fixed
- Build-breaking syntax error in profiles/build/route.ts (broken merge artifact)
- Double clearTimeout bug in convex/transcript.ts

### Removed
- Dead Prisma layer (schema, SQLite databases, generated code)
- Unused memory helper modules (context-builder.ts, profile-builder.ts)
- Tracked Python bytecode and empty legacy directories
- Memory/profile/semantic-search dependencies from chat pipeline

### Added
- Shared system prompt module (src/lib/chat/system-prompt.ts) with tests
- Convex query for transcript chunks up to timestamp
- getEpisodeById public query for video title in chat context

## [Unreleased]

- Feature backlog and deferred work tracking (`docs/feature.md`)
- This changelog (`docs/changelog.md`)
- NBrain demo note: documentation maintenance now watches this changelog as part of the repo docs graph.
- NBrain full DeepWiki demo note: merged PR updates append evidence to the Roadmap & Changelog docs without replacing the generated page.

### Research
- Deep-dive technical analysis of codebase (architecture, bugs, security, performance)
- Context management research: prompt caching vs summarization vs RAG
- Cost analysis for LLM conversation patterns with prompt caching
